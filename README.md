## uniswap-v3-periphery-truffle

Since I prefer to develop smart contracts under truffle, I made this truffle version of uniswap.

Just changed the original project from hardhat to truffle, and the other basics have not changed, except that the test has not been moved over.

I will update from time to time and try to keep this project consistent with the original project. If you are not obsessed with truffle, it is recommended to use the original project.
